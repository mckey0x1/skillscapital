# SkillsCapital Homepage

This project implements the **SkillsCapital homepage** with a **modular component-based architecture** using **Next JS** and **Tailwind CSS** for styling. Each section of the page is separated into reusable components, making the codebase **clean, maintainable, and scalable**.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

The homepage is built by **dividing the layout into independent components**, each responsible for a specific section or functionality.  
These components are then **combined** in the main `Home` component to create the complete structured UI.


### **Styling**
- **Tailwind CSS** is used for utility-first styling.
- Responsive breakpoints ensure **mobile-first** adaptability.
- Predefined gradients, colors, and spacing for brand consistency.

### **Responsive Design Features**
- **Adaptive Text Sizes & Gaps** â€“ Typography and spacing adjust according to screen size.
